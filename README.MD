# Memory Card Game
* This is my take on the "Memory Card Game" project from "The Odin Project", Javascript path, React course.

## The Objective
* To create a memory card game that the user lose when selecting a card for the second time.
* To fixate using React hooks when creating functional components.

### About the game theme
* I used images and characters from the anime "DragonBall Z" in good faith.
* I do not own or was I endorsed in anyway by the owners of said assets.
* Upon request from the owners I will remove any/all of their assets.
